# Microsoft Daily Trading Visualization 

This is for a walkthrough that complements a presentation on Big Data visualization. For this example, data source is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset). Under `stocks` there is a specific file for `MSFT.csv` that I have pickled and stored in this repo.
