# Microsoft Daily Trading Visualization 

This is for a walkthrough that complements a presentation on Big Data visualization. For this example, data source is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset). Under `stocks` there is a specific file for `MSFT.csv` that I have pickled and stored in this repo.

I followed the methodology found in this [Medium](https://medium.com/wealthy-bytes/visualizing-free-stock-data-for-algorithmic-trading-with-python-and-matplotlib-dca1abbd286c) article.
